level 1 : host my PC needs to communicate with host my little brother's computer :
so A to B IP of A will be B's IP + 1
host my Mac needs to communicate with host my little sister's computer :
same here so B's IP will be A's - 1;

level 2: host Computer B needs to communicate with host Computer A :
B -> A; B's IP = 222; A's IP = 221
so B to A, the mask need to be the same and A's IP will be B's - 1
host Computer D needs to communicate with host Computer C :
D -> C; D's IP = 2; A's IP = 1
mask /30 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 it the last 2 bits for "host addressing"
so (conventionally we take 42 but other could have works) C's IP = 42.42.42.1 and D's gonna be C's + 1 as before

level 3: host A needs to communicate with host B but there is a switch :
A -> B; A's IP = 104.198.208.125; B's IP = 104.198.208.124
A -> C; A's IP = 104.198.208.125; C's IP = 104.198.208.123
B -> C; B's IP = 104.198.208.124; C's IP = 104.198.208.123

level 4: router :
A -> B; A's IP = 116.116.117.132; B's IP = 116.116.117.131 
A's Mask = 255.255.255.240; B's Mask = 255.255.255.240
A -> R1; A's IP = 116.116.117.132; R1's IP = 116.116.117.130
A's Mask = 255.255.255.240; R1's Mask = 255.255.255.240
B -> R1; B's IP = 116.116.117.131; R1's IP = 116.116.117.130
B's Mask = 255.255.255.240; R1's Mask = 255.255.255.240

level 5: The Mighty Router
A -> R1; A's IP = 51.248.13.125; R1's IP = 51.248.13.126 *
A's Mask = 255.255.255.128; R1's Mask = 255.255.255.128
B -> R2; B's IP = 134.201.242.255; R2's IP = 134.201.242.254
B's Mask = 255.255.192.0; R2's Mask = 255.255.192.0
A -> B; A's IP = 116.116.117.132; B's IP = 116.116.117.131 
A's Mask = 255.255.255.240; B's Mask = 255.255.255.240
A's routes : default ==> 51.248.13.126
B's routes : default ==> 134.201.242.254
from what i understand A's IP depend on routes

level 6: host webserv.non-real.com needs to communicate with interface Somewhere on the Net :
internet I: Internet
Routes :
107.200.10.0/0 => 163.172.250.12

level 7: src : screeshot
